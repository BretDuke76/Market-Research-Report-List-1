<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RTD Resistance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire RTD</li><li>Three-wire RTD</li><li>Four-wire RTD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RTD resistance market comprises three main types of configurations: two-wire, three-wire, and four-wire RTDs. Two-wire RTDs are simple and economical but can have errors due to lead resistance. Three-wire RTDs mitigate this issue by utilizing a third wire for compensation, making them more accurate for temperature measurements. Four-wire RTDs offer the highest accuracy, as they eliminate lead resistance effects entirely by separating the current supply from the voltage measurement, thus ensuring precise temperature readings in industrial applications.</p></p>
